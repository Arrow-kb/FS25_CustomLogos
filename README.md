# FS25_CustomLogos

This mod allows you to put a custom image onto any vehicle using a simple custom in-game file explorer when buying a new vehicle at the shop, in order to put your own logo on your vehicles. Images can be moved, scaled and rotated accordingly.

Not multiplayer compatible - most likely never will be
